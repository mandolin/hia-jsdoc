# JSDoc Runner

Runs JSDoc in standalone and HIA integration modes.

`runHiaJsdoc()` writes a generated config file and invokes the real JSDoc CLI from the installed `jsdoc` package.

`runHiaJsdocProject()` wraps the same JSDoc execution in a `documentation-producer-result` contract for HIA project builds.
